            <p class="a">Millions experienced severe disruption as record-breaking winds from Storm Eunice<br> caused death and injury, huge structural damage, transport chaos and widespread power cuts.<br><br>

                Four people were confirmed to have died in the UK and Ireland by Friday evening. The Met Office said a wind speed of up<br> to 122mph was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight on Friday, provisionally the highest ever in England,<br> and described the storm as the worst since the Burn’s Day storm 32 years ago in which 47 people died.<br><br>

                About a third of the UK population – about 20 million people – were told to stay at home<br> as the Met Office imposed two rare red warnings for much of southern England, south Wales and London.<br><br>

                The disruption closed thousands of schools and businesses. About 435,000 homes were left without<br> power early on Friday evening. Hundreds of train services and flights were cancelled, and major roads closed.</p>
